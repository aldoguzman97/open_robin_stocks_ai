# Open Robinhood Ai

The Future of Automated Investing is Here! ðŸŽ‰ (not quite)

  We are thrilled to introduce the repo that makes life-changing automated investing strategies possible for everyone. This powerful Python package combines the power of AI with an easy-to-use interface, so you can deploy stunningly accurate trading models in a matter of minutes. (This repo someday maybe)

Really its a work in progress to integrate openai's jukebox engine and davinci_003 engine to trade stocks more intelligently. While developing my own python code I realized my code shared uncanny simililarities to 2018kguo original version of it. First Github repo Project. Let me know if Im doing everything wrong. THX.
